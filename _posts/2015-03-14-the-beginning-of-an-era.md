Hi folks!
Creating a blog is among my New Year's resolutions. I'll be writing about
software engineering, doing my best to give unique contributions to software
development community.

All the code I write will be shared on [My GitHub](https://github.com/rafaelsales).
Please feel free to contribute with any critics, suggestions and pull requests :)

Happy coding!
