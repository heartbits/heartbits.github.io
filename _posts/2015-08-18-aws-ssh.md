Currently I work at [Buzzstarter Inc.](http://buzzstarter.com), and I've been working on the web app, which infrastructure is hosted in [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com). In general, we don't really need to SSH into EC2 instances because the deployment pipeline is fully automated with [OpsWorks](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks), but in many cases it's still useful to quickly jump into servers console. Here are some reasons you might want to do that:

* Check application health in detail when information provided by other services such as NewRelic, AirBrake, CloudWatch, Rollbar were not enough
* Perform **Q**uality **A**ssurance at system-level. E.g.: QA deployment changes that cause system packages to be updated
* Verify responsiveness of a particular server

### The problem

Our environments are very dynamic - we often make changes in our servers configuration and sometimes, due to unexpected issues, we have to shutdown or spin up a new EC2 instance, so our servers are constantly changing IP addresses. A while ago, I used to keep my SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`) with a mapping of server names with their IP addresses, but I was getting tired of updating that file due to constant changes.

You probably heard about [AWS-CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) - a tool that allows you to interact with Amazon infrastucture via command-line. Unfortunately, there's really no easy way to make use of that to get access via SSH to your instances.

For a while I was really dreaming of being able to SSH to any EC2 instance with just a friendly name in hand. It would be also pretty cool to list the instances per Stack (configured in OpsWorks), so that I could quickly jump into every server of one environment - let's say I want to SSH into servers of Staging environment.

### The solution

Yesteday I launched [AWS-SSH](https://github.com/buzzstarter/aws-ssh) - it's a simple tool that made my dream come true. I think it's a lot easier to show how useful is that by showing examples, so check out below how to setup and use it.

### Setting up the tool

*NOTE: the CLI can be run through both `aws-ssh` and `awssh`.*

1.    Make sure you have `aws-cli` installed and configured. Follow guide in https://github.com/aws/aws-cli

2.    Install aws-ssh gem: `gem install aws-ssh`

3.    Create a file named `.awssh` with default options:

    ```
    profile: your-app-aws-cli-profile-name
    region: us-east-1
    user: custom-machine-user-for-ssh
    ```

### Examples

1.    List servers filtered by name `staging`. Here we use option `-so`, which is the short of `--show-only`, i.e., it will list only, and not try to SSH.

    ```
    $ awssh -so staging
    ssh user@10.20.30.40 => Buzzstarter Staging - staging-app
    ssh user@10.20.30.41 => Buzzstarter Staging - staging-worker

    # All hosts in one-line (suitable for CSSH):
    user@10.20.30.40 user@10.20.30.41
    ```

2.    SSH into first production app server. Here we use regex to filter server hostname.

    ```
    $ awssh prod.*app1
    user@prod-rails-app1:~$ # you can now interact with this server from now on
    ```

3.    In first example, you can observe the last line of the output contains a whitespace-separated list of servers. We can use that as an input to a Cluster-SSH tool in order to SSH into multiple servers at once. I'm gonna use [tmux-cssh](https://github.com/dennishafemann/tmux-cssh) for example:

    ```
    $ tmux-cssh $(awssh -so prod.*app | tail -1)
    ```

    The result is:

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tmux-cssh.png)

4.   If you are user of OpsWorks, you can also filter by Stack name: The `-s` is the short of `--stack`, which value is a regex:

    ```
    $ awssh -so -s qa
    ssh user@10.20.40.40 => Buzzstarter QA - testing-app
    ssh user@10.20.40.41 => Buzzstarter QA - testing-worker

    # All hosts in one-line (suitable for CSSH):
    user@10.20.40.40 user@10.20.40.41
    ```
